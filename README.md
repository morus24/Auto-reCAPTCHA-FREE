How does it work?
We automate the browser to solve the reCAPTCHA. Instead of image captcha, we are solving the audio captcha. The audio captcha is easier to solve programmatically.

One warning: Google may block your IP if you solve too many captchas in a short period of time. So, use this script wisely or change your IP frequently.
